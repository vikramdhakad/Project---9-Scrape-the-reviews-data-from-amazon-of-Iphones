P.Rajesh,I switched from 13 to 15,I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess! The phone have  better camera than 13 as the lens are bigger with more megapixels also the Dynamic Island makes it more fun and engaging and the gaming experience is pretty smooth and amazing as it’s having iPhone 14 Pro Max chipset.,5

vishnu prakash,Refurbished,Received a refurbished phone in the place of new phone,1
Bushan,Best for an average user.,"Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you’re willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won’t feel any difference if you’ve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn’t know unless you’ve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions.",5
Vinay Hegde,Battery health not good,"I bought this phone in Nov 2023. Within 3 months, battery maximum capacity reduced to 98%. I am really unhappy with the product.",1

Aditya Kashyap,The picture Quality,"I really love the quality of the snaps , every ry single snaps from I phone 15 is just waawii",5
Piyali Das,Loved iPhone 15,I am an apple user since 2017. Ever since I have not looked back. It is getting even better day by day. And iPhone 15 has a lot of features which I always wished the previous would have. For example it comes with a C-type charging wire. So I wont get dissapointed when I ask a non - apple user for their charger. Also the night mode camera is love. The battery lasts whole day. Overall I loved it.,5

Phone received in dead condition Amazon do not give any support ,Phone is not start,Phone is switched on,1
Amy,Almost perfect,Everything is better than my iPhone 12 except cell reception which is way worse here,4
Siva,Best iPhone of the year,"If you don’t like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won’t recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!",5
Nice,Nice phone,Nice,5

Anup,Hardware crash and poor after sales,The iPhone 15 hardware (mid system) failed after 2 weeks. I went to the service center they are repairing the phone from last 1 week but not replacing it with a new one.,1
Shubham s.,Best and must upgrade over older models,"Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.",5

Joey,First iphone and not up to the mark,"After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what.",3

Ajay Kr Chaturvedi,The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.",5
Anand,facing Liquid detection popup whenever i charge,"facing Liquid detection popup whenever i charge, i brought this phone on Nov 4th, it was working fine for 2 weeks, later when i connect with charger i see popup that liquid is detected cannot charge your mobile, i waited for 12hrs and see the same error message, then i visited to Icare center 3 times still issue remains same. please support me how to claim this ?",1
Consumer's voice,The device I almost lost within a week.,"I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‘Find My’ app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it’s not going anywhere.",5
Premchandra,Unsatisfied with the Heating issue.,Overall it's okay except the heating issue. Device got automatically heated up after watching a video at high quality.I hope apple will fix it in upcoming updates.,4
Bittu,For all things,Good quality of photos and videos. Quality  of voice calling is good battery backup is good for normal phone user time over all my first this is my first I phone,4
Mo haleem,I like this phone,,4
