If you’re willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won’t feel any difference if you’ve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn’t know unless you’ve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions."},

One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won’t recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!"},

{"User_Name": "Joey", "Review_Title": "First iphone and not up to the mark", "Rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "Review": "After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what."},

It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns."},

Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home.

Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it’s not going anywhere."},
